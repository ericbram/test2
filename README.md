# EnergyHub DevSecOps Code Sample

Hi! Welcome to the EnergyHub DevSecOps code sample.

This repository contains a simple Python web app called `buildserver`. Your goal will be to extend the CI process for this app a bit, and identify opportunities to improve the security of how we build the project.

This exercise is untimed, but please plan not to take more than two hours on it. It'll be great if you share whatever you can come up with in that time.

## The assignment

Specifically, the goals of the exercise are as follows:

1. Extend the stub CI job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to do something useful in terms of testing and building. But don't worry about actually publishing any build artifacts anywhere.

2. Surely there are some ways this whole thing can be made more secure. You can ignore the contents of the `buildserver` app itself, but see what opportunities jump out at you to improve the security of the artifact we're building and/or integrate additional security checks into the repository or CI pipeline.

    If some of these improvements are easily achievable, feel free to mock them up or implement them! Otherwise, a list of to-dos would be a good way to capture your ideas. The list doesn't need to be exhaustive.

## Submission

Please push your changes to a branch in this repository (no need to fork the repo) and open a GitHub pull request against `main`.

## Thanks!

We hope this is a good example of one kind of thing you might work on (or at least with) as part of our team. Please let us know if you have any questions, and good luck!
